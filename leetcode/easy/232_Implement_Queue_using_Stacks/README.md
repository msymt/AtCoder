# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

- void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

## 考え方

stackと違い，pop操作の時配列の先頭(0番目)を除去する必要がある．
